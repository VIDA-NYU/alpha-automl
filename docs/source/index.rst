Overview
=========

Alpha-AutoML is an AutoML system that automatically searches for models and derives end-to-end pipelines that read,
pre-process the data, and train the model. Alpha-AutoML  leverages recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and is
able to adapt to different application domains and problems through incremental learning.

Alpha-AutoML  provides data scientists and data engineers the flexibility to address complex problems by leveraging the
Python ecosystem, including open-source libraries and tools, support for collaboration, and infrastructure that enables
transparency and reproducibility.
